        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe will teach you how to make vanilla ice cream using real vanilla bean. 
            It is custard based. Once you are able to make this ice cream it will be easy to modify 
            the ice cream to whatever flavor you want.

        <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Vanilla Bean</li>
            <li>6 Egg Yolks</li>
            <li>1.5 Cups Heavy Cream</li>
            <li>1.5 Cups Whole Milk</li>
            <1i>.75 Cups sugar</1i>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Mix the whole milk, heavy cream, and ½ cup of sugar together in a saucepan. If using a vanilla bean split the vanilla bean length wise and put the seeds along with the pod in the liquid. Heat over medium-low heat until it reaches 175 degrees</li>
            <li>While the mixture is heating up, whisk together the 5 egg yolks and last ¼ cup of sugar in a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>When the cream mixture reaches 175 degrees, temper the egg mixture with about half of the cream mixture, using about a ½ - 1 cup at a time</li>
            <li>When tempered, whisk the egg-cream mixture back into the saucepan with the rest of the cream mixture</li>
            <li>Put back onto medium-low heat and constantly stir with a wooden spoon until the mixture reaches 185 degrees and then remove from the heat</li>
            <li>If you want the mixture to cool quicker you can strain the mixture into a bowl that is set in another bowl that has ice in it. (I would recommend straining the mixture as sometimes if the liquid is a little overcooked the eggs could scramble a little.)
            </li>
            <li>Once the mixture is room temperature, put a piece of cling wrap over the bowl and make sure that the cling wrap is pressed down onto the surface of the liquid. (If it isn’t a skin will form on the top of the liquid)
            </li>
            <li>Put in the fridge for at least 3-4 hours. Can go longer if you want.
            </li>
            <li>After the 3-4 hours, remove the vanilla pod from the liquid if used. If using vanilla extract add that now and stir well.
            </li>
            <li>Then pour into the ice cream machine and churn. Timing just depends on the machine. Ive used a couple of different ones and it has taken me anywhere from 20-60 minutes for it to finish.
            </li>
            <li>Once completed put in a container and again put cling wrap against the surface of the ice cream and put in the freezer for at least 2 hours.</li>
        </ol>
